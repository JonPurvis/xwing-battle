# X-Wing Battle :rocket:

[X-Wing Battle](https://jonpurvis.github.io/xwing-battle/) is a thrilling 2D space shooter built using GROK. No part of the code was wrote by a human.

You pilot an X-Wing fighter in a galaxy far, far away, battling Imperial TIE Fighters and a formidable TIE Boss. Destroy enemies to rack up points, collect droid powerups for special abilities, and survive as long as possible. With retro arcade vibes and a Star Wars-inspired aesthetic, this game offers smooth controls, dynamic visuals, and immersive gameplay.
